## Usage
Open the Cemu folder (*File > Open Cemu folder*), create a folder named `graphicPacks` if it doesn't already exist, and place the `WindWakerHD_invert3pYaxis` folder inside of it.  
Close and reopen Cemu, go to *Options > Graphic packs*, expand the list and enable the patch, then launch the game and test if it works.
