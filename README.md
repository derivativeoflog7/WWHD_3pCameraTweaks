# Credits 
The Aroma plugin uses code from [Inkay](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Inkay) (specifically, for finding the address and patching the instruction) and from the [WUPS example plugin](https://github.com/wiiu-env/WiiUPluginSystem/tree/main/plugins/example_plugin_cpp) (settings handling, logging, makefile).    
Many thanks to the Cemu team, as the debugging tools were key for me to figure this out; Maschell and techmuse for pointing me in the right direction for creating the plugin; and ComradeWave for helping me out.
